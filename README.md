# Msc-Behavioral-Data-Science

Kaggle competitions as part of a Msc big data analytics course at the University of Amsterdam.

## Amazon reviews
In this competition, the focus was on the analysis of baby products purchased from Amazon.com with the aim of predicting customer satisfaction through evaluations found in written reviews ([Dataset Link](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)). The predictive models for customer satisfaction employed logistic regressions, incorporating both shrinkage and dimension reduction methods. Within these models, a comprehensive set of features, including document occurrence, token counts, term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF), were considered. This multifaceted approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of customer satisfaction dynamics, contributing to a more accurate and insightful predictive framework.

## Facial expression recognition
This competition involved developing an algorithm proficient in recognizing emotions portrayed in facial expressions through photographs. The dataset employed for this task was the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+) (doi: 10.1109/CVPRW.2010.5543262). The dataset encompassed facial images depicting emotions such as Anger, Disgust, Happiness, and Sadness. To build the recognition model, various features including entropy, Frey and Slate features, were extracted. Both raw pixel analysis and edge analysis were executed to capture nuanced expressions. The modelling approach involved a comparative study of classification tree, multinomial regression with ridge and lasso regularization, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Model performance metrics, such as Cohenâ€™s Kappa, Sensitivity, and Specificity, were employed for evaluation. This challenge provided a dynamic platform for exploring diverse approaches to facial emotion recognition, pushing the boundaries of algorithmic proficiency in interpreting subtle human expressions.

## Physical activity recognition
In this competition, the task was to construct a classifier adept at recognizing various types of physical activities based on accelerometer and gyroscope signals. The dataset, collected in a controlled lab environment, originated from experiments where human participants engaged in diverse daily activities in a predefined sequence ([Dataset Link](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1748014)). The classifier was trained using an array of features, including statistical time-invariant features, time domain features, and frequency domain features extracted from the sensor signals. The modeling process encompassed the exploration of different classification models, such as Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), and Naive Bayes. This competition offered an intriguing opportunity to develop robust classifiers capable of discerning subtle patterns in accelerometer and gyroscope data, contributing to advancements in physical activity recognition technologies.

## Vlogger big5
In this competition, a comprehensive analysis of YouTube vlogger data was conducted using a robust dataset of 404 individuals. The dataset incorporated behavorial features, speech transcriptions, and personality impression scores with all vloggers explicitly addressing diverse topics including personal matters, politics, and recommendations ([Dataset Link](https://doi.org/10.1109/Tmm.2012.2225032)). To unveil insights into vlogger personalities, feature extractions from transcripts, audiovisual features, and gender data were extracted. Linear models were trained, aiming to predict vlogger personality scores based on the well-established Big 5 model.
